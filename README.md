# Percolation-Modeling


Percolation modelling encompasses a large area of physics from fluid flow to electronics. The type of percolations investigated in this project was sites on a square lattice occupied according to a certain probability. Neighbouring sites occupy a cluster and if a single cluster touches all four sides of the lattice it is known as a spanning cluster. 

The aim of this project was to model percolation on a square lattice and determine if a spanning cluster exists and calculate the percolation threshold.
